# Block Theme Exporter

This is a simple [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) plugin to import and export theme changes made in the database. When the plugin is activated a new menu item under the "Tools" submenu will appear. On this page there is an option to import settings from a JSON file. These JSON files can be generated from the same admin page.
